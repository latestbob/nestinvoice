Additionally, it supports file uploads for each invoice, with files stored in Cloudinary.

## Features

### File Upload:
- Upload and manage related files (e.g., images, documents) for each invoice using Cloudinary.

### User Interface:
- Built with NestJS, TypeScript, and Prisma ORM for efficient database management.
